    "## 1.1 Data vs. Signals\n",
    "- **Data** is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations, or descriptions of things. Data can be in the form of text, images, sounds, or other types of information.\n",
    "- A **signal** is a physical quantity that varies with time, space, or some other variable. Signals can be used to _represent data_, and they can be transmitted over a communication channel from one location to another. Signals can be analog or digital.\n",
    "- **Analog signals** are continuous and can take on _any value within a range_. Examples of analog signals include sound waves, light waves, and electrical signals.\n",
    "- **Digital signals** are discrete and can take on _only a limited number of values_. Examples of digital signals include binary numbers, which can take on only two values, `0` and `1`.\n",
    "- Signals can be transmitted over a variety of **transmission media**, including wires, cables, or fiber optics (guided transmission), and wireless channels (unguided transmission). The transmission medium can affect the quality of the signal and the speed at which it can be transmitted.\n",

    "- The **communication model** splits the communication process into five stages: \n",
    "\t1. **Source**: The source is the _origin_ of the message. It is the device that generates the data to be transmitted.\n",
    "\t2. **Transmitter**: The transmitter is the device that _converts the data into signals_ suitable for transmission over the channel.\n",
    "\t3. **Transmission System**: The transmission system is the medium that _carries the signals_ from the transmitter to the receiver.  The signal will be transformed as it passes through the transmission system due to noise, distortion, interference, and other factors.\n",
    "\t4. **Receiver**: The receiver is the device that receives the signal from the channel and _converts it back into data_.\n",
    "\t5. **Destination**: The destination is the device that _receives_ the message from the receiver.\n",

    "- The **source** generates **data** $m$ and turns it into an **stream** $g(t)$.  The **transmitter** converts the **stream** $g(t)$ into a **signal** $s(t)$ and sends it through the **transmission system**.  The **receiver** receives the **signal** $r(t)$ (which has been transformed by the **transmission system**) and converts it back into the **stream** $g'(t)$.  The **destination** receives the **stream** $g'(t)$ and converts it back into the **data** $m'$.  Often times the destination system will attempt to _detect and correct errors_ in $g'(t)$ to ensure that $m'$ is the same as $m$.\n",

    "## 1.3 Communication Tasks\n",
    "- **Communications tasks** are a list of key operations that any communication system must perform. These tasks include:\n",
    "\t1. **Transmissions System Utilisation**: Transmission facilities should be used _effectively and efficiently_.  This is achieved through various means such as _multiplexing and switching_.  **Power control** is also needed in wireless systems to avoid _interference_.\n",
    "\t2. **Interfacing**: The communication system must be able to interface with different types of devices and systems.\n",
    "\t3. **Signal Generation**: The communication system must be able to generate signals that can be transmitted over the transmission system.  The generated signals must be able to _propagate over the transmission system_ and should be _interpretable_ by the receiver as data.\n",
    "\t4. **Synchronisation**: The receiver must be able to know _when a signal starts and ends_ and the _duration of each signal element_ such that it can interpret the data correctly.\n",
    "\t5. **Exchange Management**: The communication system must be able to manage the exchange of data between the source and destination systems.  This includes whether both devices transmit data at the same time or one device transmits while the other receives (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex).  This requires _cooperation between the source and destination_ systems.\n",
    "\t6. **Error Detection and Correction**: The communication system must be able to detect and correct errors that occur during the transmission of data if errors cannot be tolerated.\n",
    "\t7. **Flow Control**: The sender _should not overwhelm the receiver_ with data by transmitting data faster than they can be absorbed and processed.\n",
    "\t8. **Addressing and Routing**: In a non-trivial network, the communication system must be able to _address and route data to the correct destination system_.  The communication system must assure that only the intended destination system receives the data.  Routing also includes the ability to select the _best path for data to travel_ from the source to the destination system.\n",
    "\t9. **Recovery**: Recovery is the ability of the communication system to recover from a failure of the transmission system or the source or destination systems.  The objective is to either resume the communication at the point of failure or to recover to the state of the systems before communication was initiated.\n",
    "\t10. **Message Formatting**: Messages must be formatted in a way that the receiver can interpret them correctly.  This includes the use of headers, trailers, and other control information.\n",
    "\t11. **Security**: The sender may wish to be assured that _only the intended receiver actually receives the data_.  The sender may also wish to be assured that _the data is not altered during transmission_.  The communication system must be able to provide security services such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.\n",
    "\t12. **Network Management**: Network management capabilities are needed to  monitor the system status, react to failures and overloads, and plan intelligently for future growth.\n",

    "## 1.4 Networking\n",
    "- A **network** is a collection of **nodes** and **links** that are _interconnected_ to allow the exchange of data between them.  **Point to point networks** connect every node to every other node; this is often very expensive, impractical, and inefficient.  Instead, most networks are **multipoint networks** where nodes are connected to a subset of other nodes.  The nodes in a network can be computers, servers, printers, or other devices.  The links can be wired or wireless.\n",
    "- For $n$ users to be fully connected in a point to point network, $n(n-1)/2$ links are needed.\n",
    "- To manage the huge number of devices worldwide, **local area networks (LANs)** are connected to form a **wide area network (WAN)**.\n",
    "- A **WAN** consists of a number of interconnected switching nodes.  A transmission from any devices is _routed_ through these nodes to the destination device.\n",
    "- **WAN** utilises a number of **technologies** such as:\n",
    "\t1. **Circuit Switching**: A _dedicated communication path_ is established between the source and destination.  This path is maintained for the duration of the communication.  This is the technology used in the traditional telephone system.  It's inefficient for data communication because the path is maintained even when no data is being transmitted.\n",
    "\t2. **Packet Switching**: Data is broken into _packets_ and transmitted over the network.  The packets are routed through the network to the destination.  The packets _may take different paths_ to the destination and may arrive out of order.  The destination system reassembles the packets into the original data.  Packets consist of a control block that includes the destination, error detection information, et cetera, and a data block that includes the actual data.  This is the technology used in the Internet.  Packet switching supports a data rate of `64 kbps`.\n",
    "\t3. **Frame Relay**: Since modern networks are more reliable than the early networks, frame relay is a technology that uses _packet switching but with less error checking and recovery_ than the traditional packet switching by offloading that workload to the receiver.  This makes it faster and more efficient than packet switching.  Frame relay supports a data rate of `2 Mbps`.\n",
    "\t4. **Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)**: ATM is a technology that uses _packet switching but with fixed length packets_ called **cells**.  This makes it faster and more efficient than frame relay.  ATM supports a data rate from `10 Mbps` to `1 Gbps`.\n",
    "- A **LAN** is a network that is confined to a _small geographic area_ and typically owned by the same organisation.  Data rates are much higher than WANs and the cost of transmission is much lower.\n",
    "- **LANs** can be _switched_, which is typically for fixed devices, or _wireless_ **(WLAN)**, which is typically for mobile devices.  Switched LANs are typically faster and more reliable than WLANs but require more infrastructure and are less flexible.  WLANs are more flexible and easier to use but are slower and less reliable.\n",
    "- Switched **LANs** can use a number of technologies:\n",
    "\t1. Switched Ethernet\n",
    "\t2. ATM LAN\n",
    "\t3. Fibre Channel\n",
    "- **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)** are networks that cover a city or a large campus offering a _middle ground_ between LANs and WANs.  The network can be private or public.\n",
